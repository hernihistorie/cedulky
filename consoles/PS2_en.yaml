        After the huge success of Playstation, which made Sony a major player in the video game market, the release of its successor was only a matter of time.
        After the release of Playstation 2, it was soon clear that Sony knew what they were doing, and that they could maintain the popularity of their consoles.
        In Japan, the first batch of 1.4 million consoles was sold out within the first month.
        A major advantage of this new system was its backward compatibility with the original Playstation, together with the ability to play DVD video, which paradoxically made it one of the cheapest DVD players available at the time.
        This success became unfortunate for Sega and its Dreamcast console, which was successfully pushed out of the market by Playstation 2, marking the end of an already struggling company in the domain of home consoles. Thus, Sony managed to gain a very advantageous position as the only console on the market for half a year.
        Playstation 2 has lived for 13 whole years, and remained popular long after the release of its successor, Playstation 3.
