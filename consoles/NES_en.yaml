    Nintendo was already in a good position in Japan, so it entered the market with the **Famicom** (Family Computer System). It quickly became very popular and, with its advanced graphics, managed to bring back arcade titles to TV screens.
    It wasn't as easy in America, where the video game industry had just suffered the great video game crash and this new console struggled to gain popularity. Eventually, with hits like **Super Mario Bros.** and the hard work of a few Nintendo of America employees, the console, which changed its name to **NES** (Nintendo Entertainment System), finally succeeded. Due to the lack of competition after the great video game crash (except for **Sega Master System** which became popular in Europe), Nintendo quickly defined what video games meant to most of the world.
    The NES stayed on the market for over 10 years and became an iconic game console.
    

game: Super Mario Bros.
